Aidan wrote a function that retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap.com API.

2014-05-31
Winton is starting to work on the parsing of the API info to get the info we want.
Ramy developed the algorithm.

2014-06-03
Winton and Aidan will work together on parsing of the API info as Ramy will attempt
to fix connection and debug code that opens the file.

Aidan has gotten a basic interpreter that informs users how
many layers they should wear based on the temperature in 
their area. Ramy will be helping Aidan with the rest of the 
interpreter.

Winton is working on designing a register/login functionality
to allow users to save preferences.

Aidan fixed a small error in the analysis code, where fields are pulled from the JSON
and copied to another dictionary.
Aidan found code to change proxy settings, which solved our problem with opening 
HTTP connections.
Ramy topped off some of the analysis.py code. (Ramy, please elaborate....)

2014-06-11
we now have a functional website! As in the basic functionality is there, though
there are some bugs and errors we must handle if our users input insufficient or 
incorrect information.
Winton has also started to work on a register/login feature for users to sign in 
and save cities and preferences. The basic registration and login shell structure
is there.

2014-06-12
Winton handled errors if a nonexist city/country combination is entered.
Aidan is working on the html and python code so that users only receive
recommendations based on what they check off.
Ramy finished randomization of weather messages (i.e. you can get 'It's hot'
or 'Mucho calor!')

2014-06-13
Aidan finished merging Ramy's changes and adding the code that allows users to select
information to see.

Winton created the system to reigster, login, stay logged in, and save preferences. He
never wants to hear the word 'cookie' again.

2014-06-15
Winton implemented a system to change user's passwords and debugged, A LOT. He also finally 
got to make the website all pretty with backgrounds and CSS!

Cookies MUST be set to "on" in the browser for login feature to work.
For certain cities, you may simply get " , <Country>". As far as we can tell, this is a fault 
with Open Weather Map, and not our code, since our code simply reads the city and country from
Open Weather Map.
